### Description

Black Flash is a distortion in space that occurs when coding energy is applied within 0.000001 seconds of a keystroke. When a delevoper is able to achieve this, their coding energy flashes black, and the destructive power of their strike is equal to a normal keystroke to the power of 2.5.

Unleashing Black Flash does not occur randomly and requires immense skill, concentration and typing potential to pull off.

Developers who manage to unleash Black Flash immediately gain an immeasurably higher understanding of the essence of the code base when compared to someone who has never used it. Anyone who succeeds in landing Black Flash will temporarily enter a state of increased coding awareness, where the mental process of manipulating code becomes as simple as breathing for them. This leads to a greatly increased performance in software developing, allowing the user to operate at 120% of their maximum potential.

### Usage
Out of the box you have this default keybinding:

    <leader><leader><leader>K   hit your code with a black flash
    <leader><leader><leader>k   use it without hitting the code (which is less annoying)

### Installation
Just use your plugin manager. e.g.
##### Vim-Plug
```vim
Plug('zegabr/kokusen')
```
##### Packer
```lua
use('zegabr/kokusen')
```

# Disclaimer
- This is not a really usefull plugin. I made this as a joke for ([Black Flash](https://jujutsu-kaisen.fandom.com/wiki/Black_Flash)) only to learn how to create nvim plugins.
- As black flash is very powerful using the first mapping (with upper case K) will delete some code on the current vim buffer.
