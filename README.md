### Description
achieve your best coding state


Black Flash is a distortion in space that occurs when coding energy is applied within 0.000001 seconds of a keystroke. When a delevoper is able to achieve this, their coding energy flashes black, and the destructive power of their strike is equal to a normal keystroke to the power of 2.5.

Unleashing Black Flash requires incredible concentration and no software delevoper is capable of using doing so at will, not even The Primeagen. It does not occur randomly and requires immense skill and typing potential to pull off.

Developers who manage to unleash Black Flash immediately gain an immeasurably higher understanding of the essence of the code base when compared to someone who has never used it. Anyone who succeeds in landing Black Flash will temporarily enter a state of increased coding awareness, where the mental process of manipulating code becomes as simple as breathing for them. This leads to a greatly increased performance in software developing, allowing the user to operate at 120% of their maximum potential.

### Usage
Out of the box you have this default keybinding:

    <leader><leader><leader>K   hit your code with a black flash
    <leader><leader><leader>k   use it without hitting the code (which is less annoying)

### Installation
Just use your plugin manager. e.g.
##### Vim-Plug
```vim
Plug('zegabr/kokusen')
```
##### Packer
```lua
use('zegabr/kokusen')
```
